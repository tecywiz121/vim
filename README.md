# Vim


A collection of my personal .vim and .vimrc files.

I use a number of plugins in my environment, which can be found in bundle.

## [DBGp-Remote-Debugger-Interface](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2508)

Integrates the PHP debugger into Vim.

## [RelOps](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4212)

Relative line numbers for pending operations. Changes the line number display to relative when in an operation that uses relative positions.

## [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe)

The best thing to ever happen to me. Code completion. Code completion everywhere.

## [detectindent](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1171)

Figures out what style of indentation a file uses, and sets vim to match.

## [syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic)

A very close second best thing to ever happen to me. Syntax checking. Syntax checking everywhere.

## vaxe

Haxe language support for vim.

## vim-arduino-ino & vim-arduino-syntax

Arduino support in vim.

## vim-virtualenv

Support python virtual environments in vim.

## [vim-bbye](https://github.com/moll/vim-bbye)

Adds a :Bdelete command that deletes a buffer without messing up your window layout (splits.)

## [securemodelines](https://github.com/ciaranm/securemodelines)

Brings back modelines, but with a touch of security. Only allows modelines to modify some settings (ex. tabstop, expandtab, etc.)

## [ag.vim](https://github.com/rking/ag.vim)

Integrates the Silver Searcher with vim.

## [Tern for Vim](https://github.com/marijnh/tern_for_vim)
